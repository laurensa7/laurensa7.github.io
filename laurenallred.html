      <h2>An Overview</h2>
      <p><strong>Falconry</strong> is the use of trained raptors for game hunting.  Traditionally, the term "falcon" referred to a <em>female</em> bird, which were favored for hunting (due to their larger size), while the term tiercel described a male bird. The term "falcon" now applies to any bird (male or female) belonging to a species of raptor in the genus <i>Falco</i>.</p>
