    <h1>Week Four </h1>
      <h2>Notes</h2>
      <p> Forms are made using the form element. When the form is submitted it is processed through using backend code. Some of the languages used are Ruby or PHP. The form’s value is stated in HTML code and can be changed with JavaScript.
The URL that the form is processed through is the ACTION attribute. Elements are a method of the form object that returns all the HTML elements in the form. A reset button is considered not design friendly because of its ability to wipe out all information on the form. Form control types that are common are : input , select , textarea and button. Preventdefault()  keeps the form from accidently being submitted. Preventdefault is useful because when developing the site you don’t send information that you don’t want out on accident during the testing stage on developing the form. Forms have blur, change and focus events that come when a user starts interacting with the form.
