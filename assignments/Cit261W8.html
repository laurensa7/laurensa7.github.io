      <p>The transform property lets people scale, rotate and scew any element that is on a page. This property give more control then was in the past. If you want to move an object up, down ,right or left use the translate function. The rotate function rotates an element. CSS3 transforms donâ€™t work in internet explorer versions before version 9. The steps to declare a transition CSS are as follows : declare the original state of the element in the style declaration , and declare the transition functions in the declaration. The transition-timing-function lets you control the pace of the transition. You can draw anything with javascript use HTML Canvas. To start drawing with canvas add a canvas element to the page. SVG stands for scaled vector graphics. SVG uses a file format called XML.
