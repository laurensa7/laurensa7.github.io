Feedback when data is entered wrong in a form is called form validation. When validation is done in the browser it is called client-side. Required will specify whether a form needs to have data in it before it is submitted. Min and max specifies the min and max values of numerical types. Types specifies whether the data needs to be an email or a number. Client side form validation sometimes requires Javascript if you want to customize styling and error messages but it always requires you to think carefully about the user
