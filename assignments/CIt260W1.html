      <p> My first questions is what does the book mean when it talks about using Git from the command line? I use git desktop and push my projects to that but I am betting that is not it. 
List of steps to develop software : Think- think about what the customer might want or need. Design- draw out how the application is going to work. Test- decide the end goal of what your application will do and how it will help someone who uses it. Create- build the application. Find bugs and go back and adjust the first three steps as needed to be able to have a useful and completed project. I liked the suggestion of looking at the world and how it functions to help better understand javascript and web applications. Thinking of the pages as something that is functioning when in use will help with building it. I like the idea of giving the function name a verb describing the action of the function.</p>
