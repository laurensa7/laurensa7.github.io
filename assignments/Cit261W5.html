    <h1>Week Five </h1>
      <h2>Notes</h2>
      <p>Error messages : System error – there is a problem with the system, programmer error- typo or incorrect syntax, and user error means the data is entered incorrectly. Warning error means the code does have an error but the error isnt so big that the code can’t run. Test for errors a lot so there is not silent errors later in the code. Also will make user experience better if there is no hidden errors in the code. Linting tools can be used to test the quality of the java script code. The alert debugging method is very helpful by putting stops in the code so we can see the errors. A browsers debugging tool can be used with the console to find the bugs and errors in an interactive way.  </p>
