      <h2>Notes</h2>
      <p>An object is a set of functions and related values that is self -contained.  An object keeps information together so it is more organized. An object literal is created directly in the language when wrapping all its properties and methods in curly braces. A great thing about object literals is they can be created fast and they don’t need a class. An object literal is created with curly braces. If you want to access properties use the dot notation  and it will return the value of the property. When trying to check to see if the object has a particular property it uses the “in” operator. To find all the properties of an object use a “for in” loop. Nested objects can be created putting objects inside objects. The date object can be used to create date objects. Once a date object is created the getter method will get you info about that date. JSON uses literal objects from JavaScript for information and the benefits is that it is portable format. An elements attributes can be accessed using getAttribute method and you can update the attributes using the setAttribute method. The innerHtml method can be used to put html right into the dom. </p>
