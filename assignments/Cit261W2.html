      <h2>Notes</h2>
      <p>Comments in code help someone else who is reading your code to better understand your code. A block is good to use when writing more than one statement in JavaScript. JavaScript’s 7 data types are string, symbol, number, Boolean, undefined, null. Use the JavaScript operator typeof for finding out the value’s type. Give variables a name that makes sense to what is describing. Variables are case sensitive. Meaning it has be the same. For example BOOK and book are not the same variable. If and else statements are used to control the flow of the code when written. For loop and while loop are similar but their syntax is different. Functions return values and if it isn’t stated well it will read back as undefined </p>
